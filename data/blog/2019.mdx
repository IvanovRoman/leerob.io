## Personal

Hands down, my biggest life event this year was getting engaged to my now fiancée, Allie.
I planned a surprise party so her family and friends could all be there to celebrate the moment. It was unforgettable.

Shortly after, I sold my condo and purchased a new townhome with Allie. This was not a simple process.
Part of the complexity came from listing "for sale by owner" instead of with a realtor.
I could write an entire article on the pros & cons of owning vs. renting, but let's just say it was a long three-month process.

I had the opportunity to travel a lot this year. Denver (x2), Kansas City (x2), Milwaukee, Exuma, and last but not least [Italy](/blog/italy) 🇮🇹
I attended lots of concerts, including my two current favorite bands [LANY](https://thisislany.com) and [The Band CAMINO](https://www.thebandcamino.com/).
